# Social-Network-Analysis-Project

**Abstract:** Every artist wants to make it to the top and become popular. But would it be easier to achieve this goal on your own, counting solely on your talent, or is it better to use the help (and popularity) of other artists to become popular yourself? The aim of this paper is to analyse if popularity is linked in any way to the number of songs an artist has made in collaboration with other artists by making use of networks.

The analysis was conducted on a network of over 10K artists that are linked by songs they have worked on together and whose semantic is given by the popularity index. The data has been collected through Spotify API and analysed using Gephi.

The popularity of an artist is influenced by the number of collaborators in most of the cases (the more popular the collaborators are, the better), although there exist some artists who are extremely popular on their own, without having too many connections, or, on the contrary, they have many connections, but their popularity index has a lower value (their collaborators also had low popularity).
